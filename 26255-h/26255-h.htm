<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h3>A GREAT SURPRISE FOR THE PLUMMERS</h3>
</div>

<p>Mamma Plummer read a letter
at the dinner-table before she
touched her soup. She had been having
visitors and had not had time to
look at it before. And she was always
in a hurry to hear from Aunt
Kate.</p>
<p>Aunt Kate! All seven of the young
Plummers pricked up their ears.</p>
<p>Aunt Kate was &#8220;the right kind,&#8221;
as Tom Plummer said. She remembered
all the young Plummers&#8217; birthdays,
and even when she was in Europe
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
sent home beautiful presents
that arrived in Poppleton on the very
day. A present is so much better on
the very day.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aunt Kate is lonesome, in her new
house, without any young people,&#8221;
said Mamma Plummer, at last. &#8220;She
wants to borrow one of you children
for six months.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a chorus of delight from
the young Plummers. Mamma Plummer
sighed a little. People were always
saying, &#8220;How many there are
of the Plummers,&#8221; but Mamma
Plummer never thought there were
too many.</p>
<p>&#8220;Probably she wants one of us,&#8221;
whispered Dorothy, who was sixteen,
to Polly, who was eighteen.</p>
<p>Sydney, who was fifteen, waited
eagerly. He thought Aunt Kate
might have heard of the picture on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>
the barn door and mean to give him
a chance to become a great artist.
Any one could see that the picture
meant a man on horseback, with a
pipe in his mouth, and that the man
was Michael, their gardener, even if
Tom did pretend to think it was the
town pump.</p>
<p>Oliver stood up on a round of his
chair; he was short, and he had such
a little, squeaky voice that he had to
get up high to make people notice
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;She <i>may</i> want one of the youngsters,&#8221;
said Polly doubtfully. &#8220;She
said Trixie was a quaint child.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not a quaint child,&#8221; said
Trixie, as if her feelings were hurt.
&#8220;And I&#8217;m not the one who can leave
home just as well as not. So many
things disagree with Bevis, and the
Bantam rooster pecks my chicks.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You sha&#8216;n&#8217;t go,&#8221; said Papa
Plummer, patting her head. They
all knew that Trixie was a home body.
Once, when she tried to stay at Aunt
Sarah&#8217;s, they had to bring her home
in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>&#8220;If she wants me,&#8221; said Tom,
&#8220;I&#8217;m her man.&#8221; But Tom was eating
his dinner just as if nothing had
happened.</p>
<p>Tom was twelve, and had learned
that you can&#8217;t have everything you
want in this world, and that the
things you get sometimes turn out
better than the things you want and
can&#8217;t get.</p>
<p>Another one of the Plummers was
quietly eating his dinner. That was
because he was sure that Aunt Kate
didn&#8217;t want him. None of the others
had even thought of Sonny Boy. It
was a matter of course, they would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
have said, that Aunt Kate didn&#8217;t
want Sonny Boy.</p>
<p>Sonny Boy was ten. His name was
Peter, but Mamma thought that
too large a name for a small boy.
Besides, there was another Peter
Plummer&mdash;his cousin&mdash;who lived on
Pippin Hill. Both Peters were
named for Grandpa Plummer.</p>
<p>All the other Plummers were handsome,
but Sonny Boy was snub-nosed
and freckled and a trifle cross-eyed,
and his curly hair was so red that the
boys pretended to warm their hands
and light matches by it. He had
stooping shoulders, too, and perhaps
his legs bowed a little.</p>
<p>And he was not very bright at his
lessons, while all the other Plummers
<i>were</i> bright.</p>
<p>So, except his mother and grandmother,
people didn&#8217;t think so very
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
highly of Sonny Boy, though they
liked him well enough, and he was
very often left out of good times.</p>
<p>Sonny Boy ate his dinner and only
thought that the one who was borrowed
by Aunt Kate would be pretty
lucky. He thought it would be Polly,
and he rather hoped so, for Polly always
thought he would better be sent
to bed early when there was company.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mamma Plummer! Please decide
who is to go and not keep us waiting!&#8221;
cried Polly eagerly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your Aunt Kate has decided
which one she wants,&#8221; said Mamma
Plummer. And then her glance wandered
down the long table and
rested wonderingly, although lovingly,
just where one would have least
expected.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aunt Kate wants Sonny Boy,&#8221;
she said.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Sonny Boy!&#8221; echoed all the young
Plummers in a chorus of astonishment.
Every one of them could see
plenty of reasons why Aunt Kate
should want him or her, but not a single
reason why she should want Sonny
Boy to stay with her six months.</p>
<p>Sonny Boy blushed red with surprise,
and then he blushed redder
with delight, and then reddest of all
because everybody was looking at
him.</p>
<p>And then he stole a glance at Mamma
and at Grandma. The first thing
is, you know, to be sure that those you
love best are glad with you. Then
Sonny Boy whispered to Tom.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you wanted to go, Tom, I&#8217;d
stay,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Naw-w,&#8221; said Tom, with the contempt
of one who has not been invited.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Or if you thought they&#8217;d let me
belong to the Company, I&#8217;d rather
stay home and belong than to go to
Aunt Kate&#8217;s,&#8221; added Sonny Boy.</p>
<p>Tom was one of the boys who were
getting up a company of soldiers, but
Sonny Boy had never dared to say
before that he wanted to join it.</p>
<p>Tom laughed aloud. &#8220;A great soldier
you&#8217;d make, Sonny Boy! The
fellows wouldn&#8217;t want you to belong,&#8221;
he said.</p>
<p>Tom didn&#8217;t mean to be unkind, but
he thought that when a boy was rather
bow-legged and never had got out of
the small school, he ought to know
that he wasn&#8217;t cut out for a soldier.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s well enough for him to go
and visit his Aunt Kate,&#8221; thought
Tom.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must remember not to give
Bevis pound-cake when I&#8217;m gone,&#8221;
said Sonny Boy, looking very cross-eyed
indeed at Trixie, as he always
did when he had a good deal on his
mind. And surely to go away from
home, suddenly, for six months, is a
good deal for any person to have on
his mind!

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3>SONNY BOY GOES ON A JOURNEY AND MAKES FRIENDS</h3>
</div>

<p>Sonny Boy set out, all alone, for
the city in which Aunt Kate
lived. Papa Plummer thought that
any kind of a boy of ten ought to be
able to make a little journey like that
alone.</p>
<p>The whole Plummer family went
with Sonny Boy to the Poppleton station
and gave him charges, while they
waited for the train. &#8220;Write every
day,&#8221; said Mamma Plummer, &#8220;and
learn to spell, and don&#8217;t touch Aunt
Kate&#8217;s scissors to your curls.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Say your prayers,&#8221; whispered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
Grandma Plummer, &#8220;and change
your wet feet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t lose your money,&#8221; said
Papa Plummer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Eat your soup from the side of
the spoon, and don&#8217;t say &#8216;ain&#8217;t&#8217; nor
&#8216;is that so,&#8217;&#8221; said Polly, in a severe
tone.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t scuff nor speak through
your nose, and don&#8217;t say &#8216;No-sir-ee&#8217;
to Aunt Kate,&#8221; said Dorothy.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you go to the circus that was
here last summer, find out whether
the Wild Man is truly wild,&#8221; said
Tom, &#8220;and see what a big drum costs&mdash;big
enough for the Company.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Go to a dog-man and find out
what is good for Bevis&#8217; dyspepsia,
and whether he may eat cookies,&#8221;
said Trixie.</p>
<p>And then the train came whizzing
along, and, with his cage of white
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span>
mice under his arm, and his turtle
sticking its head out of his jacket
pocket, Sonny Boy went into the car.</p>
<p>As the train moved off Sonny Boy
shut his teeth tight together. In his
heart he was afraid he should be
homesick, like Trixie.</p>
<p>He took the paper off the cage to
give his white mice the air, and a woman
in the seat behind jumped and
screamed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, take them away! Take them
away! They&#8217;ll get out!&#8221; she cried.
&#8220;Anyway, they&#8217;ll frighten my baby
into fits!&#8221;</p>
<p>Then immediately the conductor
came along and angrily told Sonny
Boy that that wasn&#8217;t a menagerie car,
and he must either throw those things
away or carry them into the baggage-car.
He said some people with a
screeching parrot were out in the baggage-car.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
They would not trust their
parrot there alone, and people in the
cars wouldn&#8217;t hear it screech.</p>
<p>Sonny Boy, with a very red face,
followed the conductor to the baggage-car.</p>
<p>On a trunk a little girl was sitting,
with her nurse, a rather cross-looking
woman, beside her. Between them
was a large cage. &#8220;If you want to
leave your live stock here, you can go
back to the car. I guess &#8217;twill be
safe enough,&#8221; said the conductor.
But Sonny Boy shook his head firmly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, what lovely little dears!&#8221;
cried the little girl. She was about
as old a little girl as Trixie, but she
had a bright, grown-up manner that
made Sonny Boy feel bashful.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pussy? Pussy? Scat!&#8221; shrieked
the parrot from the little girl&#8217;s cage.</p>

</p>
</div>

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t Polly wonderful to know
that they are mice?&#8221; cried the little
girl to Sonny Boy.</p>
<p>But the mice, not being used to pussies,
did not mind hearing her call a
cat in the least.</p>
<p>Some were quietly nibbling at a
lump of sugar which Trixie had put
into the cage for them, and some were
trying to thrust their heads through
the wires to see the world.</p>
<p>&#8220;Polly is a gray African parrot,&#8221;
said the little girl. &#8220;She knows a lot,
and she&#8217;s worth a hundred dollars.
We are carrying her to Otto, at the
hospital, but we are a little afraid
they won&#8217;t let him keep her there, for
some don&#8217;t like her voice.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I like it,&#8221; said Sonny Boy, politely
and truthfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;So do I like your mice,&#8221; said the
little girl as politely.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span></p>
<p>And then they felt they had known
each other for a long time.</p>
<p>They sat down on a large trunk,
with the cage of mice between them,
and Sonny Boy told the little girl that
the mice with black spots on them
were Spaniards, and showed her just
which of the white ones were Dewey
and Sampson, and told her that the
dashing little fellow that led all the
others in daring swings and leaps
was Hobson.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, if Otto could only see them!&#8221;
cried the little girl. &#8220;He loves soldiers.
He wants to be one, and only
think! he isn&#8217;t like other boys. His
back isn&#8217;t straight and he is lame,
and though he is eleven you wouldn&#8217;t
think him more than eight.&#8221;</p>
<p>To be lame was worse than to be
bow-legged, and Sonny Boy felt a
thrill of pity for Otto. He hoped
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
Otto wasn&#8217;t cross-eyed, and he quite
longed to ask if fractions and spelling
came hard to him.</p>
<p>When it was nearly dark the nurse
said that the next stopping-place
would be their station, and she put
a newspaper over the parrot&#8217;s cage
and made ready to leave the car.</p>
<p>The train would reach the city soon
after it left their station, she said, so
Sonny Boy covered his mouse-cage
with a newspaper, too, and prepared
to say good-bye to his new friend.</p>
<p>There was great hurry and bustle
when Lena and her nurse reached
their station, but Lena ran back after
she had gone down the car steps to
tell Sonny Boy that he was one of the
nicest boys she had ever seen, and had
been beautifully kind all the afternoon
to her and to her nurse. Sonny
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
Boy wished that Polly could have
heard her!</p>
<p>In the great city station Aunt
Kate&#8217;s big, pompous coachman came
shouting through the crowd for
&#8220;Master Peter Plummer.&#8221; And
Sonny Boy had to stop to think who
it was he meant, for in Poppleton he
was never called anything but Sonny
Boy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Take your things, sir?&#8221; said the
pompous footman, just as if Sonny
Boy were grown up!</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll take this, please,&#8221; said Sonny
Boy, keeping hold of the cage.
&#8220;It&#8217;s full of white mice.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dewey! Sampson! Hobson! Cock-a-doodle-doo!
Pussy! Pussy! Scat!
Polly wants a cracker!&#8221; cried a shrill
voice from the cage. And the pompous
coachman stared in amazement.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3>SONNY BOY GOES IN SEARCH OF HIS WHITE MICE</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;My dear Sonny Boy!&#8221; Aunt
Kate leaned out of her carriage,
ready to take him, big cage and
all, into her arms.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cock-a-doodle-doo! Remember
the Maine! Dewey! Sampson! Hobson!&#8221;
screamed the parrot again.
And the crowd following Sonny Boy
and the coachman cheered and
cheered.</p>
<p>Sonny Boy was afraid they would
tear the cage from his arms. And
they might have, had not the coachman
used his fists to clear the way.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Get us out of this, Jarvis!&#8221; said
Aunt Kate.</p>
<p>Jarvis made the horses plunge forward,
but Sonny Boy could hear the
shouts following them along the
street.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&mdash;she&#8217;s a remarkable parrot,&#8221;
said Sonny Boy faintly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I should think so!&#8221; said Aunt
Kate.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t exactly bring the parrot.
She belongs to another fel&mdash;another
girl,&#8221; explained Sonny Boy, a little
confused.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so glad!&#8221; said Aunt Kate
heartily.</p>
<p>&#8220;I had my white mice in a cage
just about as large as this. You
ought to see them! Trixie and I have
drilled them into two armies, American
and Spanish, and we&#8217;ve got the
commanders on both sides&mdash;and, oh,
I don&#8217;t know where they are now! I
changed cages with a girl!&#8221;</p>

&#8220;THE COACHMAN USED HIS FISTS TO CLEAR THE WAY.&#8221;<br />
</p>
</div>

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Oh, we&#8217;ll find them, never fear!
And the girl shall have her parrot,&#8221;
said Aunt Kate, growing suddenly
very cheerful.</p>
<p>When they reached Aunt Kate&#8217;s
house a beautiful Angora cat ran into
the hall to meet her mistress. &#8220;Scat!
Scat!&#8221; screamed the parrot. She had
torn the newspaper off the cage with
her sharp beak and was taking a look
around her.</p>
<p>Off whisked the cat in terror, and
hid, so that no one could find her.
Then Aunt Kate&#8217;s little poodle waddled
up to the cage. &#8220;Bow-wow!&#8221;
barked the parrot. And they couldn&#8217;t
drag the poodle out of the coal-cellar
that night!</p>
<p>Sonny Boy lay awake that night
longer than he had ever lain awake
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
a night in his life, planning how to rid
himself of that parrot and get his
white mice again.</p>
<p>In the morning Aunt Kate sent out
for all the daily papers, but there was
no advertisement of a lost parrot in
them. The parrot, with her cage muffled,
was shut up in the back attic, but
Aunt Kate had a nervous headache.</p>
<p>Sonny Boy felt sure that she was
wishing she had borrowed some other
one of the Plummers who wouldn&#8217;t
have brought a parrot, and he was
very unhappy. When Aunt Kate sat
down at her desk to write an advertisement
for a girl who changed a parrot
for a cage of white mice, Sonny
Boy stole up to the attic and got the
parrot, and slipped out at the front
door. He did not know the name of
the station where Lena and her nurse
had stopped, but he knew that it was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
the next station to the city, and that
there was a children&#8217;s hospital there.</p>
<p>When Aunt Kate had said they
couldn&#8217;t find the little girl without
advertising, as they did not know her
last name, Sonny Boy had been too
bashful to tell her he thought he could.</p>
<p>But of course any little Poppleton
boy knew what tongues were made
for, and Sonny Boy felt he could
make things come out right if that
parrot would only keep still!</p>
<p>He had learned the way to the station
and was hurrying on when a
newsboy&#8217;s cry about the war aroused
Polly.</p>
<p>She shouted all her war-cries, and
such a crowd gathered that Sonny
Boy was forced to turn into a side
street and run.</p>
<p>But fortunately the side street led
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
to the station, and once on board the
train Polly became quiet.</p>
<p>He got out at the station where
Lena had left him, the day before, and
inquired for the children&#8217;s hospital.</p>
<p>There was no children&#8217;s hospital,
he was told, but there was a children&#8217;s
ward in the big general hospital on
the hill, which the station-agent
pointed out to him.</p>
<p>He rang timidly at the great door
of the hospital, then waited a long
time.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hurry up! Hurry up!&#8221; shrieked
Polly. And a man, looking very much
astonished, opened the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to see a boy named Otto,&#8221;
said Sonny Boy. &#8220;I want to give
him his parrot and&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you his brother?&#8221; asked the
man. &#8220;Only relatives admitted.&#8221;
And when Sonny Boy shook his head
he shut the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cock-a-doodle! Remember the

<p>The man opened the door enough to
look at the parrot.</p>
<p>&#8220;Please won&#8217;t you see if Otto has
my white mice?&#8221; urged Sonny Boy.</p>
<p>&#8220;His sister is here. You might
send for her to come out,&#8221; said a boy
in buttons at the man&#8217;s elbow.</p>
<p>The great door was closed again,
but in a few moments it opened and
Lena&#8217;s startled face appeared.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t do it on purpose,&#8221; she
said, her cheeks growing very red.
&#8220;But I did hope you would like her
better, for Otto is just wild over the
mice!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like her better!&#8221; said Sonny
Boy stoutly.</p>
<p>&#8220;We think Otto ought to have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
everything. When you see him
you&#8217;ll think so, too,&#8221; said Lena.</p>
<p>&#8220;I sha&#8216;n&#8217;t think he ought to have
my white mice,&#8221; said Sonny Boy
firmly.</p>
<p>The girl opened wide the big door,
as if it belonged to her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come!&#8221; she said, beckoning to
Sonny Boy.

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h3>SONNY BOY FINDS A CROOKEDER BOY</h3>
</div>

<p>Sonny Boy followed Lena
through the great door.</p>
<p>The doorkeeper said if he was a
friend of hers he might go in for a
little while, but the parrot must be
kept outside; she was too noisy.</p>
<p>The boy in buttons seemed very
willing to take care of Polly. He said
he would carry her out upon the
grounds and give her an airing.</p>
<p>Lena led Sonny Boy into a large,
long room, which she said was the
&#8220;almost well&#8221; room of the children&#8217;s
ward.</p>
<p>&#8220;But we&#8217;re afraid Otto never will
be well,&#8221; she whispered, turning a sad
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span>
little face toward Sonny Boy, as she
opened the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Otto, the mice boy has come to see
you!&#8221; she said to a white-faced,
humpbacked boy, who sat propped
up in a chair, at a table, with the
cage of mice before him.</p>
<p>The boy drew the cage towards him
and placed his thin white hands over
it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you come for them?&#8221; he
asked, with a sob in his throat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me show you what they will
do!&#8221; said Sonny Boy, and sat down
opposite him at the table.</p>
<p>Those mice had been trained before
Sonny Boy had them, and for two
years he and Tom and Trixie had
been teaching them. When either of
the young Plummers had the mumps
or the measles, or there was a long
storm, it meant several new tricks for
the white mice! and they could now
do really wonderful things.</p>
<div class='figcenter'>

&#8220;&#8216;LET ME SHOW YOU WHAT THEY WILL DO.&#8217;&#8221;<br />
</p>
</div>

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span></div>
<p>Since the war with Spain had begun,
they were taught soldier tricks
altogether. And it was so fortunate
that some had black spots, for those
could be Spaniards!</p>
<p>All the children in the ward who
could walk crowded around the table,
and the matron and the nurses, too.</p>
<p>It was such a good time that many
an ache and pain was forgotten for
many minutes. When Sonny Boy let
the mice out of the cage and they
scampered all over the table, then the
children scampered, too&mdash;every one
who could. Even the matron and the
nurses uttered little screams.</p>
<p>But Sonny Boy whistled, and into
the cage marched those mice like soldiers!
It was really a wonderful
sight to see.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span></p>
<p>And the worn and tired looks were
gone from so many children&#8217;s faces!</p>
<p>Otto&#8217;s poor, shrunken, misshaped
body shook with laughter. &#8220;I want
to know how you trained them!&#8221; he
said. &#8220;I want to train them! I want
to do everything that well boys do&mdash;that
you do! And I&#8217;m going to learn!
Lena is only a girl, and I never had a
brother. I think I could even learn
spelling and fractions if you would
show me how!&#8221;</p>
<p>Sonny Boy blushed. He began to
say that he was not much for spelling
and fractions himself, but Lena
touched his foot.</p>
<p>&#8220;Spelling and fractions are nothing!
I&#8217;ll show you how to do them,&#8221;
said Sonny Boy stoutly.</p>
<p>&#8220;And you&#8217;ll show me how to
straighten my legs, so I can be a
soldier, won&#8217;t you?&#8221; said Otto.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span></p>
<p>Sonny Boy moved about uneasily
on his bow-legs. &#8220;It&#8217;s queer! I want
to be a soldier, too,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Yes,
I&#8217;ll show you, Otto.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re what I&#8217;ve been wanting&mdash;a
well boy!&#8221; said Otto, with a happy
sigh. &#8220;You&#8217;re very bright and
clever, aren&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no,&#8221; began Sonny Boy, but
Lena touched his foot again.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Plummers are called a smart
family,&#8221; said Sonny Boy firmly, although
his cheeks burned. &#8220;My
brother Tom and my sister Trixie are
very clever.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course you couldn&#8217;t have
trained those mice if you hadn&#8217;t been
very clever,&#8221; said Otto.</p>
<p>&#8220;Those mice have done him good.
I&#8217;ve never seen him so bright,&#8221; whispered
the matron. &#8220;They&#8217;ve done
all the children good!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And although I went away off to
Uncle Fritz&#8217;s to get the parrot for
him, he says he doesn&#8217;t like a parrot,&#8221;
whispered Lena.</p>
<p>&#8220;You like a parrot, don&#8217;t you?&#8221;
said Otto, eagerly, to Sonny Boy.</p>
<p>&#8220;I never was very well acquainted
with one before. I think this one has
a fine voice,&#8221; said Sonny Boy politely.</p>
<p>&#8220;You like her better than you do
the mice, don&#8217;t you? You&#8217;ll swap,
won&#8217;t you?&#8221; said Otto.</p>
<p>Now this, thought Sonny Boy, was
hard! And what would they say at
home? Trixie herself had trained
the big mouse with the black spots on
his ears that they called Admiral Cervera,
and Tom would never be willing
that Hobson should go out of the
family!</p>

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span></div>
<p>But Sonny Boy&#8217;s heart ached with
pity for the poor, humpbacked,
shrunken fellow, whose face looked
like a little old man&#8217;s. And Lena
leaned over Sonny Boy&#8217;s shoulder
and whispered:</p>
<p>&#8220;Just think! He never has had one
good time!&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can have them!&#8221; said Sonny
Boy, although he had to swallow a
great lump in his throat.</p>
<p>He got away as soon as he could
then, for fear he should cry, Otto
making him promise that he would
come again just as soon as he could.</p>
<p>The delightful little glow at Sonny
Boy&#8217;s heart, such as you always feel
when you have made any one happy,
was queerly mixed with the grief of
losing his white mice.</p>
<p>When he got to the entrance door
he found that Polly had been shut up
in a dark closet, because she whooped
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span>
and shouted so that the boy in buttons
had not been able to keep her out
upon the grounds.</p>
<p>When Sonny Boy took her again
into his arms and started to go back,
just as he had come away, he almost
wished that Aunt Kate had borrowed
some other one of the Plummers!

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h3>SONNY BOY BECOMES A SCHOLAR</h3>
</div>

<p>Polly was so lively on the way
back to the city that Sonny Boy
didn&#8217;t dare to take her into a passenger-car.
The smoking-car happened
to be almost empty, and the conductor
said he would better go in there.</p>
<p>Polly didn&#8217;t like the empty smoking-car.
She wished to be where there
were plenty of people to admire her,
and she showed her displeasure by
making a dreadful noise. She barked
and miaowed and cackled and crowed,
and squealed and lowed and whinneyed
and brayed and squawked and
roared and growled, until one would
have thought the smoking-car was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span>
nothing less than Noah&#8217;s Ark. A
crowd of people came rushing into the
car, and among them was a man who
looked like a sailor, who insisted upon
taking the covering from Polly&#8217;s cage
and holding her up to the light.</p>
<p>&#8220;Belong to you?&#8221; he said. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
want to sell her, do you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Sonny Boy&#8217;s heart gave a great
leap. He was himself so very tired
of Polly&#8217;s voice, and he had so dreaded
to take her back to Aunt Kate, that
it did not seem to him possible that
any one could want her.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s a handsome bird,&#8221; continued
the man, &#8220;and hasn&#8217;t she got
a voice! She isn&#8217;t exactly the bird for
a home pet, but at a show she&#8217;d draw.
And I belong to a show.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man seated himself beside Sonny
Boy and spoke in a low tone.
&#8220;&#8216;The Wonder of the World&#8217;&mdash;that&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
the name of the show that I
belong to,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>That was the very circus that had
been at Poppleton the summer before,
the one that Tom had been so much interested
in!</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, then, perhaps you know all
about the Wild Man of Borneo!&#8221;
cried Sonny Boy eagerly. &#8220;Have
you ever seen him <i>near to</i>?&#8221;</p>
<p>The sailor looked confused, and
there was a queer twinkle in his eye.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am some acquainted with the
Wild Man,&#8221; he said slowly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did he really come from Borneo?
And is he truly wild?&#8221; asked Sonny
Boy with eager curiosity.</p>
<p>&#8220;He is just about as wild as they
make them,&#8221; said the man, wagging
his head solemnly. And Sonny Boy&#8217;s
heart thrilled with fear and wonder.</p>
<p>&#8220;We tried to play Wild Man in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
our barn,&#8221; he said to the man. &#8220;But
none of the fellows knew how to be
wild. Tom wanted me to find out
how.&#8221;</p>
<p>The sailor drew near to Sonny Boy
and lowered his voice to a whisper.
&#8220;It wouldn&#8217;t do to let everybody
know it, but if you and I are going
to make a bargain about that parrot
I don&#8217;t care if I tell you that I&#8217;m the
Wild Man of Borneo, and I&#8217;ll show
you just how I do it! I&#8217;ll give you
twenty dollars for the parrot, and I&#8217;ll
throw in the Wild Man business! I&#8217;ll
do more than that&mdash;I&#8217;ll get you a
chance to ride on the buffalo, in the
procession, when the show comes to
Bolton, this summer!&#8221;</p>
<p>Bolton was the town where the hospital
was&mdash;the town they had just
left. It would be easy to get to Bolton
to the show.</p>

&#8220;&#8216;I&#8217;LL GIVE YOU TWENTY DOLLARS FOR THE PARROT.&#8217;&#8221;<br />
</p>
</div>

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span></div>
<p>Twenty dollars might be a small
price for the parrot, but the secret
of being a Wild Man and the chance
to ride on a buffalo were extras that
a boy could not easily resist! The
parrot changed hands, and so did two
ten-dollar bills. And the man gave
Sonny Boy his address so that he
might find him when the show came
to Bolton.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t you stuck up? Scat!&#8221;
screamed Polly after Sonny Boy, by
way of good-bye, when they parted at
the city station.</p>
<p>Sonny Boy was very penitent when
he found, on reaching home, that his
absence had made Aunt Kate very
anxious. She said a dreadful thing;
she said that she never could trust
Sonny Boy again!</p>
<p>But Sonny Boy knew she would
find out that he wasn&#8217;t the kind of a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
boy that runs away. He thought it
was enough to make any boy lose his
mind to change his white mice for
that parrot!</p>
<p>Aunt Kate thought that twenty dollars
was a plenty for the parrot! She
said she would see about the extras.
She didn&#8217;t seem to understand the
advantages of learning to be a Wild
Man or of riding on a buffalo.</p>
<p>But she said she thought of taking
a house at Bolton for the summer,
while her husband was away at the
war; it was seashore, and it was also
near the city, where she could hear
the war-news soon.</p>
<p>And then Sonny Boy felt sure that
he should not miss his extra pay for
the parrot.</p>
<p>His sister Polly would not think
that a boy ought to want to ride on a
buffalo; she would say that none of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
the Plummers had ever done such a
thing. But Aunt Kate was different.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are other things I want,
Aunt Kate,&#8221; said Sonny Boy suddenly,
and he stood as tall as he could
before his aunt&mdash;so tall that his shoulders
scarcely stooped and his bow-legs
were almost straight. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got to
have them!&#8221; Sonny Boy&#8217;s red cheeks
grew quite pale and his voice was
gruff with feeling.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Sonny Boy dear, what can
the things be that you want so much!&#8221;
said Aunt Kate wonderingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Spelling and fractions,&#8221; said
Sonny Boy firmly.</p>
<p>&#8220;You dear boy! I never heard of
a boy who thought so much of his lessons
as that!&#8221; exclaimed Aunt Kate.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s to show another fellow&mdash;stupider
than I am,&#8221; said Sonny Boy.
&#8220;And crookeder. I&#8217;ve got to get
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
straight and be a soldier, too, to show
him how.&#8221; And he told her about
Otto.</p>
<p>Aunt Kate hugged him and laughed
a little and cried a little. And she
said it was a beautiful idea and he
should have a tutor so that he could
learn spelling and fractions very fast.
And he should go to a gymnasium and
straighten his shoulders and his legs.
And his uncle would take him to camp
to see the soldiers drill.</p>
<p>And she would buy him some more
white mice. But that last offer Sonny
Boy declined. He wanted no white
mice but those! And he didn&#8217;t want
those, because he liked better to have
Otto and the poor invalid children
have them.</p>
<p>It was quite wonderful to see how
Sonny Boy learned spelling and fractions.
The tutor was surprised, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
what the Poppleton schoolmistress
would have thought no one can even
guess! For Sonny Boy had been dull
at his lessons.</p>
<p>And presently he straightened himself
out in the most surprising way,
and learned to drill soldiers like a
major. He had a fine military company,
in the &#8220;almost well&#8221; room of
the children&#8217;s ward at the hospital.
The officers sent word to Aunt Kate
that he was a very welcome visitor
and did the children great good.</p>
<p>He bought a drum and fife with the
parrot money, and sent them to the
Poppleton Guards, the company to
which &#8220;the fellows didn&#8217;t want him
to belong.&#8221; And he wrote a letter to
the Guards, telling them about the
military tactics that he had learned
at the camp, where his uncle had
taken him.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span></p>
<p>&#8220;How quickly you have learned!&#8221;
said Aunt Kate one day. &#8220;You are
the very brightest one of the Plummers.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Sonny Boy shook his head. &#8220;I
never could learn until &#8217;twas for another
fellow,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Anyway, you&#8217;re the dearest one
of the Plummers!&#8221; said Aunt Kate,
with a hug. By this time they were
at Bolton for the summer, and they
awoke one morning to find the place
gay with show-bills and huge placards.</p>
<p>The &#8220;Wonder of the World&#8221; was
coming to town. Among the attractions
were the &#8220;Wild Man of Borneo,&#8221;
fresh from his native jungles,
and &#8220;The Monster Tuscarora,&#8221; the
greatest buffalo in the world.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h3>WHO WAS CAPTAIN OF THE COMPANY?</h3>
</div>

<p>The great show, the &#8220;Wonder
of the World,&#8221; had come to
town. It came in the night and packed
itself away in the big tents on Lawton&#8217;s
field.</p>
<p>A &#8220;monster street procession&#8221;
was announced for the next morning,
and the Bolton boys and girls lay
awake as if it were the Fourth of
July.</p>
<p>Sonny Boy had received a large
square ticket, marked &#8220;Season,&#8221; and
&#8220;Complimentary,&#8221; and in the same
envelope was a slip of paper on
which was written, &#8220;<i>Ask for J. Simpkins
at the door.</i>&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span></p>
<p>J. Simpkins was, of course, Sonny
Boy&#8217;s friend, the Wild Man.</p>
<p>Aunt Kate said she felt doubtful
about &#8220;that Wild Man business,&#8221;
and she wrote to her husband about it.</p>
<p>&#8220;It won&#8217;t do him any harm to learn
to be a Wild Man.&#8221; That was Uncle
William&#8217;s answer; and Sonny Boy
thought he was a very sensible man.</p>
<p>Aunt Kate also wrote to Mamma
Plummer about the Wild Man and
the buffalo, although she didn&#8217;t tell
Sonny Boy of that. And Mamma
Plummer answered, &#8220;Sonny Boy
could never learn to be a wild man;
the dear boy is so quiet. And he
would be scared to death at the sight
of a buffalo.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mamma Plummer did not quite understand
her Sonny Boy.</p>

&#8220;OTTO HAD HIS ONE GOOD TIME.&#8221;<br />
</p>
</div>

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span></div>
<p>Sonny Boy asked for J. Simpkins
at the tent door, showing his bit of
paper, and he was told to follow a
porter straight to the cage of the most
ferocious-looking Wild Man that ever
was seen!</p>
<p>He had horns, and he had tusks,
and a mane like a horse, and yet when
he laughed, Sonny Boy could see, as
plainly as could be, that he was only
the sailor who had bought the parrot!</p>
<p>If one could only be a Wild Man
like that, in their barn at Poppleton,
thought Sonny Boy, what fun it
would be!</p>
<p>But there was no time to take a lesson
in being a Wild Man this morning,
as the procession was to start
soon. And it happened that the boy
who rode the buffalo was ill with the
mumps, so they really needed another
boy.</p>
<p>And the buffalo boy&#8217;s scarlet and
gold-laced tunic and trousers were an
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
exact fit for Sonny Boy, who looked
quite straight and handsome in them!</p>
<p>That buffalo was such a huge beast
that Sonny Boy had to mount him by
means of a step-ladder. He was bigger
than any geography buffalo you
ever saw. And he tossed his horned
head and pawed the ground with his
great hoofs in a way that made Sonny
Boy&#8217;s heart go pit-a-pat.</p>
<p>But there was no outward sign that
Sonny Boy&#8217;s heart was going pit-a-pat.
He was not going to miss the
proudest moment of his life because
he was afraid! When he rode out
into the crowded street, the huge buffalo
following after the troops of tiny
Shetland ponies, the better to show
his size, and the crowd shouted and
cheered, if Sonny Boy did for a little
while forget even Otto it was not
strange!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span></p>
<p>But Otto did not allow himself to
be forgotten. He wanted to see that
procession with his own eyes. He had
lain awake all night thinking about it.
When the hospital supply-wagon was
at the gate in the morning he watched
his chance to slip out unobserved, and
climbed into the back of the wagon!</p>
<p>It hurt him so that his white face
grew whiter and there were drops on
his forehead. He broke one of his
crutches, too, and the other fell out of
the wagon. But he was not found
out! The driver was in a hurry, perhaps
because he wished to see the procession
himself. He jumped into the
front of the wagon, without a glance
at the back, and off down the hill rattled
the wagon, with Otto in the back,
in his dressing-gown, with a hospital
blanket pinned over his shoulders.</p>
<p>Just as the hospital wagon reached
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span>
the procession the band struck up and
the horse was frightened and jumped.
It gave the wagon just enough of a
jerk to throw Otto out. He was tossed
into the little space between the ponies
and the buffalo. The beast&#8217;s
great hoofs were almost upon him!</p>
<p>There was a wild cry from the
crowd, but it was Sonny Boy who
slipped from his high perch and, not
an instant too soon, drew his friend
out of the danger.</p>
<p>Sonny Boy lost his own footing;
the buffalo&#8217;s hoof grazed his arm and
tore the gold lace of his tunic.</p>
<p>Friendly hands were ready to lift
him again to his seat, while the crowd
cheered him until it was hoarse.</p>
<p>&#8220;Otto first! Lift him up here and
I will hold him on. It&#8217;s his first good
time.&#8221; The marshal of the procession
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span>
made no objection, since it was
something that pleased the crowd.</p>
<p>Up went Otto, in his blanket, to the
front place, frightened, but not hurt,
and Sonny Boy held him securely,
and the crowd went wild!</p>
<p>Above all its noise a shrill voice
suddenly came to Sonny Boy&#8217;s ears.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cock-a-doodle-doo! Aren&#8217;t you
stuck up?&#8221;</p>
<p>And if there wasn&#8217;t Polly, in a
great gilt cage, swinging high above
the Fat Lady&#8217;s chariot!</p>
<p>Polly had been calling out the
names of all the wonders in the show,
as she had been taught, but when she
saw Sonny Boy she remembered old
times. She shouted out all the patriotism
she knew, and the band played
Yankee Doodle, and the people said
that the best was what was not down
in the bills.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span></p>
<p>Otto had his one good time! One
would scarcely have known him, his
face was so bright and rosy.</p>
<p>It was almost a miracle that he had
not been killed under the buffalo&#8217;s
hoofs, but the ride did not hurt him
in the least. And he is still telling
the hospital children, over and over
again, all the wonders of that procession
in which he rode to the end of
the route on the buffalo, and then back
to the tent in the Fat Lady&#8217;s chariot!
For Sonny Boy found the Wild Man
both a kind and influential friend.</p>
<p>He has learned to be a Wild Man
himself; there was a show in the
Plummers&#8217; barn, at Poppleton, in the
fall, that many people thought equal
to a grown-up circus, and the Wild
Man was the chief attraction.</p>

</div>

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span></div>
<p>But none of the Plummers were so
much surprised that Sonny Boy had
learned to be a Wild Man as they were
that he had learned spelling and fractions
and straightened out his stooping
shoulders and his bow-legs!</p>
<p>Sonny Boy explained that he had
done it to help a slower and a crookeder
boy than himself. And when
Otto came down to Poppleton to pay
Sonny Boy a visit they understood a
little better.</p>
<p>Lena came, too, and they brought
the white mice, and those skillful performers
took part in the barn show.</p>
<p>Sonny Boy and Otto still think
there was nothing in the &#8220;Wonder of
the World&#8221; to beat those white mice.</p>
<p>Within a week after he returned
to Poppleton, Tom told Sonny Boy
that if he would only join the Guards
as the fellows wanted him to he would
surely be chosen captain!</p>
<p>&#8220;It would sound well&mdash;&#8216;Captain
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
Sonny Boy Plummer, of the Poppleton
Guards,&#8217;&#8221; said Tom. And when
I last heard from Poppleton that was
what Sonny Boy was called&mdash;Captain
Sonny Boy Plummer, of the Poppleton
Guards!</p>
<p>And every one of the Plummers
was wishing to be the one that Aunt
Kate would borrow next.</p>
<p>And in a little while none of them
remembered that they had ever
thought it queer that Aunt Kate
wanted to borrow Sonny Boy!</p>
